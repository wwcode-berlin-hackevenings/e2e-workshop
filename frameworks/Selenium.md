# Selenium


## What is Selenium?

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a tool to automate and control browsers ðŸ¤–. It's main use case is testing, but it can also be used to automate tasks. It has been around for a long time and has helped countless teams over the years to automate their tests!

The Selenium "family" consists of several different tools to help with the creation and execution of tests, for example an IDE.
What we will be using for e2e tests is [Selenium Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/), a collection of binding for different programming languages that allow us to interact with the browser.
This means we can use any of the supported programming languages and easily control the browser.

We can then use a testing library  of our choice to check if the results of the browser interaction are as expected.

## Templates for Selenium

The following templates are available for writing e2e tests in different languages, but all using the the Selenium Webdriver to automated the browser.

- **Javascript**: [Javascript Selenium Template](https://github.com/wwcode-berlin-hackevenings/selenium-javascript-template)
- **Python**: [Python Selenium Template](https://github.com/wwcode-berlin-hackevenings/selenium-python-template)


Each template repo also contains links to the Selenium documentation for your language of choice and for the test framework.


Follow the instructions in the template repo to setup your local enviroment to be able to run the tests.
If that does not work, the (Javascript) repo also has a GitHub Action workflow setup to run the tests as an Action.
This is less fun though, because you don't get to see the browser automation in action!
